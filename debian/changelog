zsys (0.3) focal; urgency=medium

  * Daemon/client split, communicating via unix sockets. Most notable changes:
    - new client command with zsysctl. Daemon is zsysd.
    - communication is done via GRPC. Logs for a particular client/request are
      streamed over network, with different log levels.
    - permission for every command is mediated by polkit. root has access to
      everything on daemon side, different level of actions are in available
      in a dedicated const.
    - daemon is socket activated, and tear down automatically after a grace
      idling period.
  * i18n integration.
  * Add man pages (autogenerated).
  * Autogenerate autocompletion, even for hidden commands.
  * Refactoring and cleaning up.
  * A lot of CI changes (migrated to github actions).
  * zsys backward compatibility script with eoan zfs generator.
  * Migrated to go 1.13.

zsys (0.2.4) focal; urgency=medium

  * Skip tests on platform we don't build a binary for
    (no grub2-common package available).
    Autopkgtests will still try to run it if it ever ran one day
    and would fail as it can't install zsys.

zsys (0.2.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * Add caching for optimizing Scan() calls (from multiple seconds depending
    on the amount of snapshots to subseconds).
  * Fix update-grub not working when started by zsys boot systemd service.

zsys (0.2) eoan; urgency=medium

  * Add userdata hidden subcommand for creating and renaming user datasets.
    (LP: #1842902)
  * Build-dep on grub2-common to not produce s390x build for now until
    we support an alternative bootloader.

zsys (0.1.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * Reduce cyclomatic complexity of some functions which results in better
    code readability and perf.
  * Hook up "modified boot" printing on command line so that we can avoid
    rerunning useless scanning.
  * Additional tests for covering modified boot tags.
  * Restrict daemon commit privilege in systemd service.
  * Now that go-libzfs upstream merged our fix, switch back to it rather than
    our fork (content is exactly the same).
  * debian/changelog:
    - ensure we dep on grub.
  * debian/zsys.lintian-overrides:
    - we only support systemd in ubuntu (and ship a service file).
