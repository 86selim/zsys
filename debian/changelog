zsys (0.2) eoan; urgency=medium

  * Add userdata hidden subcommand for creating and renaming user datasets.
    (LP: #1842902)
  * Build-dep on grub2-common to not produce s390x build for now until
    we support an alternative bootloader.

zsys (0.1.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * Reduce cyclomatic complexity of some functions which results in better
    code readability and perf.
  * Hook up "modified boot" printing on command line so that we can avoid
    rerunning useless scanning.
  * Additional tests for covering modified boot tags.
  * Restrict daemon commit privilege in systemd service.
  * Now that go-libzfs upstream merged our fix, switch back to it rather than
    our fork (content is exactly the same).
  * debian/changelog:
    - ensure we dep on grub.
  * debian/zsys.lintian-overrides:
    - we only support systemd in ubuntu (and ship a service file).
